What is Express Router?
Express Router is a feature provided by the Express.js framework that allows you to create modular, mountable route handlers. It's essentially a mini version of an Express application that can handle specific routes or groups of routes.

It helps in organizing your application into manageable and reusable modules, especially in large-scale applications. With express.Router, you can define routes in a modular way and then link them to the main app.

Why Do We Need Express Router?
Modular Code: In large applications, it can be difficult to manage all routes in a single file. express.Router allows us to split routes into smaller files, making the code easier to maintain and read.

Separation of Concerns: It encourages separating route logic into different modules based on functionality, such as user routes, admin routes, or product routes.

Reusability: Routers can be reused across different parts of the application, improving code efficiency and reducing duplication.

Middleware Management: You can apply specific middleware to certain routers without affecting the entire application.

Key Points for Interviews
What is it?: A modular way to handle routes in Express.
Why use it?: For better code organization, reusability, and middleware management.
When to use?: In medium to large applications where routes can be grouped by functionality.
How to use?: Create routers using express.Router(), define routes, and mount them to the main app with app.use().
